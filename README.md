## Description
Welcome! My name is Michael Rath and this is my HVAC calculator app I completed for my associates capstone class while attending Renton Technical College. This is indows desktop application that gives a user the ability to enter material and structural information about their home and location, which will then calculate the appropriate size equipment to buy, in both a simple and advanced format. All calculations are in accordance with ACCA Manual J. 

## Technologies
Project is created with
* .Net Framework 4.8
* C#

## Roadmap
* As this was a classroom assignment, I have no further plans for additions or improvements
